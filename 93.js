// // NAMATE JAVASCRIPT

// do you know how javascript works and how the code is executed

// is javascript synchronous or asynchronous

// is javascript single threaded or is it multi-threaded


// first core fundamental is everything in javascript happens inside the execution context 

// you can assume this execution context to be a big box or a container in which whole javascript code is executed 
// so let us now see how this execution context actually looks like ----

// in context is like a big box and it has two components in it

// the first component is also known as the  memory component so this is the place where all the variables and functions are stored as a key value pairs

// suppose we have a variable a which is equivalent to 10 it will be stored over here and similarly functions are also stored over here in this memory component.
// (key : value)===(a : 10) and fn: { ...} -- (functions)

// this memory component is also known as variable environment.

//variable environment --- it's sort of an environment in which all these variables and functions are stored as the key value pairs 

//the second component of this execution context is the code component
// so this is the place where code is executed one line at a time. 
// so this is also known as thread of execution 
// this thread of execution is just like a thread in which the whole code is executed one line at a time.

// so javascript is a synchronous single threaded language .
// when i say single threaded that means javascript can only execute one command  at a time and when i say synchronous

// single threaded that means that

// javascript can only execute one command

// at a time and in a specific order okay

// so that means that it can only go to the

// next line once the current line has been

// finished executing so that means

// synchronous single threaded language so

// let's revise once again javascript is a

// synchronous single threaded language

// i know that you must be thinking then we

// have heard of something known as ajax

// right where a stands for asynchronous so

// what does that means

// don't worry we'll cover everything we'll

// be going slowly and we'll be

// understanding each of these concepts

// properly as we go ahead so for now just

// remember that javascript is not possible

// without this beautiful execution context

// so let's just quickly recap what we

// studied this whole thing which you can

// see is the execution context the first

// component is known as the memory

// component the second component is known

// as the code component memory component

// contains variables and functions as the

// key value pairs and this code code

// component is the place where whole

// javascript code is executed memory

// component is also known as the variable

// environment and the code component is

// also known as the thread of execution

// i know these are a lot of jargons and

// trust me these things are really very

// important and nobody teaches them but i

// am here on a mission to make you fall in

// love with javascript and don't worry

// continue along with me and we'll be

// covering everything in deep so in the

// next video i'll actually walk you

// through a real javascript program we

// will see how this whole beautiful

// execution context is created how this

// memory section is created how this code

// is executed inside this code component

// everything will cover in the next video

// but before jumping on to that video you

// have to do two things first is to like

// this video it gives me a huge motivation

// and the second thing is to comment down

// what you liked about this video and are

// you feeling excited or not so that's all

// in this video and thank you for watching

// namaste javascript

// [Music]

// you
